# Sudoku Project

You can find the instructions of the project in the file [sudoku.ipynb](sudoku.ipynb).

To submit your solution, please modify the file [sudoku.lp](asp/sudoku.lp) of the directory [asp](asp) with your encoding.

Every time you push a new commit, your solution will be tested automatically.
The timeout per instance is `100` seconds, and
the actual command call for the test is:
* ``python asp/test.py -e asp/sudoku.lp -i asp/instances -s asp/solutions -t 100``

For help, type `python asp/test.py --help`.

The script was developed for Python 3.8.

After the tests are run, you will be able to see the results in the Actions tab:
* Select one of the tests, click in "run-autograding-tests" and go to the tab "Print output"
